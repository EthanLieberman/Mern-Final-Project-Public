# Mern-Final-Project-Public

Hello There. I led my team on a project to create a application that can take user input to give randomized results to pair food with a movie.

In our project, we used React as a frontend, Express and Node.js as frameworks, and MongoDB as our database for a MERN Single Page Application.
